Algorithm Becnhmark Tool (ABT)
=======

This is a GTK+ minor project using C for semester course. “ABT” – Algorithm Benchmarking Tool Based on Execution Time is a software tool which benchmarks runtime performances of various algorithms relevant for operations such as searching, sorting, etc. with custom data inputs. 

It serves as an educational tool demonstrating non-existence of an ideal algorithm; choice of algorithm depends on application and also patterns of input dataset type. Every algorithm has its own niche use where it performs much better than others.
